# Deriving Online Gambler Profiles by performing Cluster Analysis in SAS Viya
## Introduction
In recent years, digital payments are becoming increasingly more prevalent across the gambling industry, bringing about questions regarding how this technology might influence individualsâ€™ gambling behaviours and the potential of this technology to contribute to harm. For example, easier access to funds could encourage overspending and less transparent payment methods could obscure the value of money. The digitization of gambling payments is partly due to a broader global shift toward cash substitutes. These transformations have created a research gap in terms of understanding how these digital payments might contribute to harm, and how they might provide opportunities for harm prevention.

## Overview
The objective of this study is to employ Clustering Analysis to explore whether subgroups of gamblers can be distinguished by analysing their payment behaviour using data sourced from a gambling digital payments service provider. Specifically, this study aims to discern whether cluster analysis of payment transaction data (e.g., activity related to the deposit and withdrawal of funds) can reveal different types of gambling payment profiles.  While doing this, the secondary goal of this study is to identify whether certain markers of harm may be evident for further research exploration.

## Methodology

The following steps were followed in order to perform Cluster Analysis of Online gambler profiles
1. Data Preparation
2. Deriving appropriate cluster variables.
3. Univariate analysis to check for skewness of Cluster variables.
4. Bivariate analysis to check for multicollinearity of Cluster variables.
5. Transformations to reduce skewness of CLustering variables.
6. Decide optimum number of Clusters using Applied Box Criterion.
7. Perform K-Means Clustering in SAS Viya.
8. Interpret the Clustering Results to derive gambler profiles.
